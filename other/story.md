# V R Survivors

## Title: Embernet: Heartcode of the Wyld
## Genre: Romantic Techno-Fantasy RPG
## Tone: Bittersweet, epic, neon-lit myth meets ancient soul

### World Overview:
Aetheros, a fractured world stitched together by ancient magick and futuristic tech — a reality where code pulses like blood, and dragons soar through cyber-choked skies. Long ago, the Drakyn, celestial dragons bound to the will of love-bound souls, kept balance between realms: the Myst (natural world) and the Syn (synthetic digital arcology).

But the Heartcode — a mythical algorithm said to be the source code of creation itself — was stolen. Now, digital corruption leaks into organic reality. Creatures of ancient dreams and neural nightmares clash. The world is glitching, literally.

### Plot Hook:

Riven Vale, a biohacker with a fractured past and an illegal draconic neural link embedded in your spine — a dormant connection to a fallen Drakyn named Kaelith, once guardian of the Heartcode and your lover in a past life you barely remember.

Haunted by dreams that blur memory and simulation, you’re drawn into a war between the Wyrmguard (mystic warriors trying to restore the natural order) and the NEXUS Authority, a god-corporation seeking to rewrite the Heartcode and become gods in flesh and steel.

As you and Kaelith awaken your bond across dimensions, your romance rekindles — but every choice you make alters not just the world, but the very code of love itself.

### Core Themes:

Love as Code: The bond between Riven and Kaelith isn’t just emotional — it’s embedded in their DNA, in every line of reality's code. Their passion literally rewrites the laws of the world.

Tech vs Magic: Advanced AI symbiotes, cyber druids, and data-forged dragons collide with ancient elemental beasts and heart-bound runes. You’ll choose your path — integrate, destroy, or balance.

Memory and Identity: Riven’s past lives glitch into the present. Is love something eternal, or just well-written code repeated across lifetimes?

Rebirth and Ruin: A dragon's flame can purify or destroy. Same goes for love.

### Key Characters:

Kaelith – A sleek obsidian-scaled Drakyn with eyes like nebulae. He speaks in riddles and remembers Riven more deeply than Riven remembers himself. Their romance is primal, painful, and poetic — love that survived the rewriting of time.

Seren Vox – A NEXUS cyberwitch who once loved Kaelith in a forked reality. She now hunts you, half out of jealousy, half in grief. She's part villain, part tragic echo.

The Glimmer Court – Fae-cyber hybrids who live in the gaps between servers and trees. Neither ally nor enemy, they test your soul with riddles, temptation, and psychedelic illusions.

### Gameplay Mechanics Ideas:

Soul-Link System: Your choices deepen or weaken your bond with Kaelith. Stronger bonds unlock combo attacks, dialogue memories, and even world-altering events.

Reality Shifts: You can hack the world. Rewrite a volcanic landscape into a techno-factory — or vice versa. But every shift draws the attention of the Wyrmguard or NEXUS.

Memory Fragments: Re-experience scenes from your past lives, full of romance, betrayal, and longing. Replay them differently to alter present reality.

Dragonform Merge: Temporarily fuse with Kaelith — you become a half-dragon deity, blending claws and code, rage and love.

### Aesthetics & Vibe:

Soundtrack: Ethereal synths + deep cello + dragon roars distorted like dubstep drops.

Visuals: Glowing ruins. Neon-lit mountaintops. Digital rain falling over ancient stone circles. Cyber wings shredding through moonlight.
