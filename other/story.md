# V R Survivors

## Note
This story is not as same as in the story.json its revamped with chatgpt, my bro.

A survival game, where love meets adventure and action, with crafting and inventory spicing things up.

## Chapter - 1
The whole world was set into chaos by unknow group of enemies, nukes flying everywhere, buldings destroyed in a blink of an eye, and terror filled with the red firey sky.

## Chapter - 2 
Amidst this chaos, a group of survivous gathered, and decided that they will survive this, no matter what, they were survivalist, mixed with new people who had access to survivability at the moment, and they had make up large bunkers, with a stasis chamber where they could sleep for 100s of years without aging a day, setup with all necessary supplies, food, batteries, tech, guns, gadgets and much more.

## Chapter - 3
Beep beep, the power is low, now the decade of sleep from the stasis has come to an end, they wake up to a new world, mutated and dangerous, nothing seems real anymore as they see from the camera installed in the bunker, there are people roaming around like zombies and all other people are mentally ill, they are killing eachother for silly reasons, guess this is what happens when there is no law, all are awake now, we will work as a team and get through this we are not alone, and there are about 70 people in these 9 bunkers, we will survive

# Chapter - 4
The madness has spread like wildfire, its good that we have stored long lasting food, which will give us atleast 3 months, that all we could add to the area of 10 acres, with all the tools, belongings that were important and useful for our survival, we all were given equal spaces, but we cannot rely on whats in here we need to know more about the world there are not much survivors left outside, but we know that they cannot be trusted which makes things worse.

# Chapter - 5
Wait did I introduce myself? guess not. My name is Sven, I am 30 years old, and i have a rather young girlfriend Gwen, I love her beyond and infinity. I'm awake but she is not, I try to wake her, thank god she waked up, I hug her, she says 'What are you doing others are watching, shy. I let go, I saw my whole life flash through my eyes, at this moment I knew, I would not live without her, she is my soul, everything right now, she's my highschool sweetheart and been so ever since.
