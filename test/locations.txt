🏔️ What Are Highlands?

Definition:
Highlands are elevated regions that are higher than surrounding land but not as extreme or rugged as full-on mountains. Think rolling hills, steep cliffs, misty moors, rocky ridges—majestic but livable.
🌍 IRL Examples:

    Scottish Highlands – Misty, romantic, windblown cliffs and heather

    Ethiopian Highlands – Lush plateaus with dramatic drop-offs

    Tibetan Plateau – Called “The Roof of the World,” vast and spiritual

🧭 Biome Features:

    Terrain: Rolling hills, cliffs, stone formations, grass and shrubs

    Climate: Cool to temperate; lots of fog, wind, and drama

    Fauna: Eagles, goats, wolves—creatures built for endurance

    Mood: Ancient. Windswept. Lonely but strong.

    Civilizations: Highland clans, shepherd tribes, stone fortresses

🌫️ Fantasy Vibes:

    A place for old souls and lost relics

    Drinking songs echo across the cliffs
    
    Worn paths carved by war and pilgrimage

    Feels like the land is watching you back
